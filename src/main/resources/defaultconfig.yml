# AdvancedBungeeAnnouncer runs on a static delay between all announcements.
# This value lets you change the delay. It must be specified in seconds.
# Default: 180 (3 minutes)

delay: 180

# This option changes how announcements are selected.
# Choices available:
# - sequential: default, picks announces as they are iterated over
# - random: picks a random announcement for each server

choose-announcement-via: sequential

# This lets you set a prefix for the announcements.
# Useful if you want to give your network an "identity" of sorts.
